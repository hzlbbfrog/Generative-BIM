## ✒️ Introduction
This repository mainly includes 4 parts:  
- [ ] **Modified-dataset**.
- [ ] Structural design pipeline integrating BIM and generative AI  
      Namely, **Python and Dynamo code** to convert 3D BIM models to 2D architectural drawings and to convert 2D structural drawings to 3D BIM models. Link → [Structural design pipeline](https://github.com/hzlbbfrog/Generative-BIM/tree/main/Structural%20design%20pipeline)
- [ ] Python code of **P**hysics-based **C**onditional **D**iffusion **M**odel **(PCDM)**.
- [ ] **Evaluation code** including Score_IoU and FID.
