## ‚úíÔ∏è Introduction
This repository mainly includes 4 parts:  
- [ ] **Modified-dataset**.
- [ ] Design pipeline integrating BIM and generative AI  
      Namely, the **Python and Dynamo code** to make BIM models to 2D drawings and make 2D drawings to BIM models.
- [ ] Python code of the Physics-based conditional diffusion model **(PCDM)**.
- [ ] **Evaluation code** including Score_IoU and FID.
